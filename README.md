Tried making a dynamic dashboard and user management with routing.

⋅⋅\* Login with username admin and any password

-   admin can add, edit, delete both charts and users

⋅⋅\* Login with any name other than admin and which is already in user management visible in admin panel, pre included example of name is Nyal.

-   user if is provided with admin rights in user management will be routed to admin page else to user page.

⋅⋅\* Can export the data in excel or pdf files onClick of respective buttons.

[Let's see it in action](https://jatinsajwan3841.github.io/DD-User-management/)
